Hey there! This is the source code for [my portfolio/blog website](https://https://karam-malkon.netlify.com/.netlify.com/). I started this as a way to teach myself React and Gatsby so it's a work in progress. Feel free to check the codebase and let me know what you think!

## 👨‍💻 Tech stack

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) - Static site generator
- ~~[emotion](https://emotion.sh) - CSS-in-JS~~

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS with superpowers
