I’ve never written a blog post before. I realise this is not a good way to start a blog post… But here goes.

It’s been a while since I’ve felt this passionate about something, after landing my first job as a junior frontend developer in Sweden, I focused on the job and slowly started to lose touch with my passion. 
In hindsight, this job wasn’t the main cause for this; my mental health was not in a good spot for reasons that I won't go into in this post and I didn’t realise it until a couple years have passed.

I’m moving on to another job now as a frontend develop and will be working with the all new cool tech like React and GraphQL.

This job switch sparked my tucked away passion and pushed me to go dusting off my frontend-related newsletters -that I’ve been archiving for the past two years without even looking at the headlines- and blogs.

I started reading, watching and coding React everyday and I feel like I’m barely scratching the surface of this amazing technology.

As I was reading about React, I came across Gatsby, read the first part of their tutorial -which is brilliantly written- and the idea of not just building but actually using a blog as a platform to reinforce what I’m learning started taking shape in my head.

So this is my first post, hopefully I will be posting regularly about what I’m dabbling with.

My next post will be about the building process that I went through to get this blog up and running! 🏃‍♂

Cheers 🍻
