I’ve never written a blog post before. I realise this is not a good way to start a blog post… But here goes.

It’s been a while since I’ve felt this passionate about something, after landing my first job as a junior frontend developer in Sweden (more in this the about me page) I focused on the job and and slowly started to lose touch with my passion. In hindsight, this job wasn’t probably the main cause for this; my situation at the time and mental health were not in a good spot and I didn’t realise it until a few years have passed.

I’m moving on to another job now as a frontend develop this time and instead of using the dated AngularJS, I will be using React which.

This change sparked my tucked away passion and pushed me to go dusting off my frontend-related newsletters -that I’ve been archiving for the past two years without even looking at the headlines- and blogs.
I started reading, watching and coding React everyday and I feel like I’m barely scratching the surface of this amazing technology.

As I was reading about React, I came across Gatsby, read the first part of their tutorial -which is superbly written- and the idea of not just building but actually using a blog as a platform to reinforce what I’m learning started shaping up in my head.

So this is my first post, hopefully I will be posting regularly about what I’m enjoying currently.

My next post will be about the building process that I went through to get this blog up and running! 🏃‍♂

Cheers 🍻
