This is a continuously updated list of the learning materials that I'm using to learn React, JS and build some projects along the way.

## React & JavaScript ES6

- [React's official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and their [official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html): This is where I personally started and it was a good introduction to the React principles and way of thinking
- [Reactiflux!](https://www.reactiflux.com/learning/): _The_ React portal with Q&A transcripts, links to more tutorials and their discord channel.
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): I love this website, just use it and you'll see for yourself.
- [Building an advanced blog using Gatsby.](https://reactgo.com/gatsby-advanced-blog-tutorial/): A tutorial that I used to build this portfolio/blog.
- [The Road to Learn React book.](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/): I'm still going through this book but it's a nice condensed book that expands on a lot of the confusing (to newcomers) features of ES6 and ES7
- [HowToGraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/)

## Projects

- [11 small react projects](https://dev.to/drminnaar/11-react-examples-2e6d): Great intro projects to React that I'm using as a reference for when I get stuck.
- [6 fun react projects ](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/)
- [Dead puppies and Todo lists](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-time-you-build-a-to-do-list-app-a-puppy-dies-505b54637a5d): A few alternatives to the todo list intro app because the author hates todo lists.
- [30 I mean 5 small projects with redux ](https://github.com/alemesa/react-small-projects)
- [Example projects from React's official page](https://reactjs.org/community/examples.html): Examples from the community collected on the official React website.
